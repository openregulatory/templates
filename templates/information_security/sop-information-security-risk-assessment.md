## Summary

This document describes the process for assessing and treating information security risks within the
Information Security Management System (ISMS) at *\<your company name\>*. It outlines the procedures for risk
identification, analysis, evaluation, and treatment to ensure that information security risks are managed
effectively.

The purpose of the Information Security Risk Assessment Process is to identify, assess, and manage risks that
could potentially affect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information assets of *\<your
company name\>*. This process is vital for maintaining robust security practices and ensuring compliance with
ISO/IEC 27001:2023 standards.

This document shall be reviewed annually or upon significant changes to the ISMS or the risk landscape. All
revisions must be approved by the Information Security Officer (ISO) and communicated to all relevant
stakeholders.

## Process Steps

### 1. Risk Identification

The company will:

* Identify the risks associated with the loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information
  within the scope of the ISMS.
* Document the potential security threats and vulnerabilities that could affect the organizationâ€™s information
  assets.

|       | Identified risks            |
|       | Identified security threats |
|       | Identified vulnerabilities  |

### 2. Risk Analysis

* Analyze the likelihood of each identified risk occurring, along with its potential impact on the
  organization.
* Utilize qualitative and quantitative methods to evaluate the severity of risks based on predefined criteria.

| Identified vulnerabilities  |                                         |

### 3. Risk Assessment

* Prioritize the risks based on their likelihood and impact.
* Determine which risks are acceptable and which require further action or treatment based on the risk
  appetite of the organization.
* Identify appropriate risk treatment options such as risk avoidance, risk transfer, risk acceptance, or risk
  mitigation.
* Select specific security controls to implement from Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001:2023 or other relevant sources.
