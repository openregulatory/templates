## Summary

This document lists the information security controls as specified in Annex A of ISO/IEC 27001:2023. These
controls are intended to support the implementation of the Information Security Management System (ISMS)
within *\<your company name\>* and to address information security risks tailored to the needs of the
organization.

## Overview Over Information Security Controls

The following table summarizes the controls from Annex A that are applicable to the ISMS. These controls are
grouped by categories as defined in the standard. For more details on each security control, see the
implementation section below this overview table.

> Note that you don't have to comply with all controls listed below. Here's what you do instead: For each
> control, mark it as applicable (yes or no). If you selected "yes", then add some notes on how you
> implemented it in the sections below this table (scroll down). If you selected "no", add a comment in the
> "Comment" column on why it's not applicable, and in the "In Compliance?" column, select "n/a".
