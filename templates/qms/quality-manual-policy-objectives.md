## Summary

The Quality Manual describes the scope of the Quality Management System, its documented procedures and a
description of their interactions.

## 1. Scope

The QMS described in this Quality Manual applies to all products of *\<your company name\>*.

### Role of Company

> Other roles besides manufacturer are: Authorized representative, distributor.

*\<your company name\>* is a manufacturer of Medical Devices.

### Applicable Standards

> Remove either the MDD or MDR entry, depending on which you're complying with (MDD will only be possible
> until May 2021, afterwards it's only MDR).

The following table only gives an overview of the most relevant regulation and standards. For a comprehensive
overview, see the list of applicable standards (reference here).

| Standard / Regulation / Law | Why Applicable?                                           |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| MDD (93/42/EEC)             | Directive for all Medical Device Manufacturers in the EU  |
| MDR (2017/745/              | Regulation for all Medical Device Manufacturers in the EU |
| ISO 13485:2016              | QMS required by essential requirements of MDD/MDR         |
| ISO 14971:2019              | Risk management for medical devices                       |
| IEC 62304:2006              | Software development for medical devices                  |
| IEC 62366-1:2015            | Usability evaluation for medical devices                  |


### Exclusions

The following sections of ISO 13485:2016 will be excluded due to the product being stand-alone software:

 * 6.4.2 Contamination control
 * 7.5.2 Cleanliness of product
 * 7.5.5 Particular requirements for sterile medical devices
 * 7.5.7 Particular requirements for validation of processes for sterilization and sterile barrier systems
 * 7.5.9.2 Particular requirements for implantable medical devices

## 2. Quality Policy & Objectives

### Quality Policy

> Describe what your company is about, specifically, its mission and things which are important for it. Maybe
> you're developing software for patients with a certain disease and your goal is to improve their lives.

### Quality Objectives

> Whatever policy you outlined above, now you need to make it measurable by defining objectives which can be
> tracked. Those objectives should not (only) refer to the quality of your devices but the quality of your QMS and the overall work of your organization. > Typical examples are: hiring excellence in staff, providing best-of-class device performance, high standards of customer satisfaction, etc.
> In a next step (see short-term goals), those are narrowed down to concrete measures like for example the monthly number of user complaints.

### Short-Term Goals

> How does your team track its goals? Your auditors want to see how your quality objectives translate into
> your daily work. You should formulate strategic goals for your company that are somewhat related to your
> quality goals and which are tracked at least on an annual basis. Do you already have a goal-oriented system in
> place to track your team’s work? Even better: align business and quality goals and describe your system
> here.

## 3. Roles

> Describe the roles of the people in your company. Typically this is done by drawing an organigram (you could
> use draw.io for that). Or, you just use a table like below.

| Role            | People                    |
|-----------------|---------------------------|
| CEO             | Steve Jobs                |
| CTO             | Steve Wozniak             |
| Product Manager | Ada Lovelace              |
| QMO             | Oliver Eidel              |

All C-level roles (CEO, CTO, CMO) are referred to as the Management. Management is generally responsible to
define responsibilities and authorities, to define and communicate Quality Policy and Goals and to ensure that
the whole organization is oriented towards them.

> See ISO 13485, para. 5.1, para. 5.5.1

The Quality Management Officer (QMO) is responsible to:

* ensure that processes needed for the company’s quality management system are documented
* report to top management on the effectiveness of the quality management system and any need for improvement
* ensure the promotion of awareness of applicable regulatory requirements and QMS requirements throughout the
  organization.

Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (PRRC)
Responsibilities of the PRRC are in accordance with Art. 15 MDR as follows:
* Ensure (review / release) the conformity of the devices is appropriately checked in accordance with the QMS before a device is released (also see Art. 10 Para. 9 MDR)

* Ensure that, in the case of investigational devices, the statement referred to in Section 4.1 of Chapter II of Annex XV MDR is issued.

The PRRC shall not be subjected to Management instructions while carrying out his/her responsibilities specified above. His/her tasks may be delegated to other roles as long as it is ensured that final responsibility stays with the PRRC. She or he has the power and authority to represent the company in the scope of his/her responsibilities, e.g. in communicating with state authorities.
