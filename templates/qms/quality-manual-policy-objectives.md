## Summary

### Role of Company

### Applicable Standards

The following table only gives an overview of the most relevant regulation and standards. For a comprehensive overview, see the list of applicable standards (reference here).

| Standard / Regulation / Law | Why Applicable?                                           |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| EU Regulation 2017/745      | Regulation for medical devices for human use              |

 * 7.5.2 Cleanliness of product
 * 7.5.5 Particular requirements for sterile medical devices
 * 7.5.7 Particular requirements for validation of processes for sterilization and sterile barrier systems
 * 7.5.9.2 Particular requirements for implantable medical devices
 * 7.5.11 Preservation of product

## 2. Quality Policy & Objectives

### Quality Policy

> Describe what your company is about, specifically, its mission and things which are important for it. Maybe
> you're developing software for patients with a certain disease and your goal is to improve their lives.
>
> In addition, the policy should include a commitment to meet legal requirements, keep the QMS up to date and
> define quality objectives to work towards.

### Quality Objectives

> Whatever policy you outlined above, now you need to make it measurable by defining objectives which can be
> tracked. Those objectives should not (only) refer to the quality of your devices but the quality of your QMS
> and the overall work of your organization. Typical examples are: hiring excellence in staff, providing,
> best-of-class device performance, high standards of customer satisfaction, etc.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

> Auditors might ask you: how do you keep track of a quality objective, to see if it was achieved or not?  The
> answer is: Key Performance Indicators. As part of your management review, you have to review all QMS
> processes plus your quality policy and objectives at least annually. Now, you can meet both requirements at
> the same time by defining KPIs for your QMS processes. You can then argue that by achieving your KPIs, you
> make sure that your processes run well, which also meets your quality objectives.

> These are your action items:
> 1. Make sure to define at least one KPI for each QMS process.
> 2. Make sure each quality objectives translates into at minimum one process KPI. Where there's no
>    corresponding process for a quality objective, you define additional KPIs that are not process-related.
> 3. You can document those KPIs either in each SOP or in a separate overview sheet. For example, you can use
>    the template for a management review report for that purpose.
>
> Also see regulatory requirements: ISO 13485, para. 4.1.3.a (process KPIs) and para. 5.6.2 (management review
> input).
>
> In this section here, describe where you define your KPIs and how you keep track of them. For example, say
> that you define KPIs in every single SOP or reference to a separate, central overview sheet. Ideally, KPIs
> are tracked by each process owner independently.

## 3. Roles

> Describe the roles of the people in your company. Typically this is done by drawing an organigram (you could
> use draw.io for that). Or, you just use a table like below.
>
> Minimum requirement information: required qualification and description of tasks related to QMS process
> involvement If applicable, add: report / authority, access rights, etc.
