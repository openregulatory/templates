# Software List

> List all your software which you use either in your Quality Management System or as part of your product
> development. Typically, those include Slack, GitHub, your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ) and programming libraries
> which you (only) use during development.
>
> Libraries which you include in your product (i.e., which are deployed with it) don't belong here. They belong
> in the SOUP list.
