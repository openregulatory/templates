> usage requirements that the system shall fulfill.

## 3. Quality Relevance

*Rate these aspects with yes (y) or no (n). If any of these aspects are rated as yes, the system is quality
relevant and should be validated.*

| **Criterion**                                                                                                                         | **Y/N** |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Is the system used in one or more processes that steer the QMS?                                                                       |         |
| Could the conformity of the organizationâ€™s medical devices be affected if the system does not work according to its specifications?   |         |
| Could risks arise for patients, users, third parties or the organization if the system does not work according to its specifications? |         |

|----|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|
| U1 | e.g. "A radiologist can log in with their email and password." | "Login with correct email and password grants access to the annotation tool." | yes   |
|    |                                                                |                                                                               |       |

### 6.3 Validation of Technical Requirements

### 6.5 Conclusion

Approving the software for use is recommended due to the acceptance criteria being fulfilled completely.

## 7. Proof of Validation

> You can optionally insert screenshots for proof of validation. Strictly speaking, this is not a hard
> requirement by the standards but it's nice to show when you're being audited.

## 10. Annex: Additional Information for Criticality Classification

**GAMP Implications**

* GAMP 5 always leads to "high" software criticality
* GAMP 4 always leads to a "high" or "moderate" software criticality, depending on further risk assessment in
  step 4.2
* GAMP 1 and 3 typically leads to a "low" or "moderate" software criticality, depending on further risk
  assessment in step 4.2

**Criticality High**

* A software failure can lead to harm, requiring medical intervention
* Software manages information relevant for vigilance purposes (e.g. customer safety information or recall
  actions)
* Software manages information that is quality-relevant and its loss would lead to an audit nonconformity

**Criticality Moderate**

* A software failure can lead to harm, however, not requiring medical intervention
* Software manages information that is quality-relevant and its loss would lead to an audit nonconformity

**Criticality Low**

* Software manages information that is quality-relevant and its loss would lead to an audit nonconformity
