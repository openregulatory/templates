# SOP Software Validation

## Summary

This SOP ensures that the organization only works with validated computer/software systems to avoid erroneous
systems affecting the safety and performance of its medical devices. The process outlines requirements for
validation before use.

## Process Steps

### 1.1 Collecting Information and Preliminary Assessment

 * Employee notifies QMO of the new system and provides the minimum information required for preliminary
   assessment, such as intended use description and preliminary risk estimation.
 * QMO documents the intended use and determines whether the system is relevant for the QMS or the
   organizationâ€™s medical devices as part of the Software Validation Form.
 * If quality-relevant: continue to fill out the Software Validation Form (assessing criticality
   and risks).
 * If not quality-relevant: document the system in the Software List and release the software
   system for use.

| Responsible | Employee intending to work with the new system<br>QMO                        |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input       | Information about the system<br>Software Validation Form<br>List of Software |
| Output      | Preliminary Software Assessment                                              |


### 1.2 Plan Validation

 * QMO continues to fill out the Software Validation Form by planning the validation and
   documenting the requirements for expected validation results.

| Responsible | QMO                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Input       | Software Validation Form         |
| Output      | Updated Software Validation Form |

### 1.3 Perform Validation

 * Perform the validation based on the validation plan and fill out the validation report as part of the
   software validation form.
 * Where appropriate, save additional proof of validation (e.g. screenshots) and add them to the validation
   report.

| Responsible | Employee working with the system |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| Input       | Software Validation Form         |
| Output      | Updated Software Validation Form |


### 1.4 Release

If validation was not successful:

 * Document the validation results in the List of Software and classify the system as "blocked" /
   "not released for use".

If validation was successful:

 * Document the validation results and sign the validation report as part of the Software Validation Form.
 * Release the software by adding it to the List of Software.
 * Inform relevant staff about the approval of the system.

| Responsible | QMO                                                                                 |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input       | Software Validation Form<br>List of Software                                        |
| Output      | Completed Software Validation Form<br>Updated List of Software<br>Notification Sent |

### 1.5 Monitoring of Softwares

 * User feedback and error reports by developers are monitored for relevant occurrences that may affect the
   organization or its medical devices.
 * New version updates are implemented and the List of Software is updated accordingly. If
   necessary, a revalidation is carried out.

| Responsible | QMO in collaboration with employee working with the system                                       |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Input       | Error reports by users / developers                                                              |
| Output      | Updated Software Validation Form<br>If required: new record of Softwares Validation Form created |

### 1.6 Decommissioning of Software

 * In case it is decided to decommission a software, evaluate possible effects and document the
   actions in the List of Software.

| Responsible | QMO                                          |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Input       | Software Validation Form<br>List of Software |
| Output      | Updated List of Software                     |
