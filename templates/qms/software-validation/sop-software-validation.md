# SOP Software Validation

## Summary

This SOP ensures that the organization only works with validated computer/software systems to avoid erroneous
systems affecting the safety and performance of its medical devices. The process outlines requirements for
validation before use.

## Process Steps

### 1.1 Collecting Information and Preliminary Assessment

 * Employee notifies QMO of the new system and provides the minimum information required for preliminary
   assessment, such as intended use description and preliminary risk estimation.
 * QMO documents the intended use and determines whether the system is relevant for the QMS or the
   organizationâ€™s medical devices as part of the computerized system validation form.
 * If quality-relevant: continue to fill out the computerized system validation form (assessing criticality
   and risks).
 * If not quality-relevant: document the system in the list of computerized systems and release the software
   system for use.

| List of Softwares            |                                 |


### 1.2 Plan Validation

 * QMO continues to fill out the computerized system validation form by planning the validation and
   documenting the requirements for expected validation results.

### 1.3 Perform Validation

 * Perform the validation based on the validation plan and fill out the validation report as part of the
   software validation form.
 * Where appropriate, save additional proof of validation (e.g. screenshots) and add them to the validation
   report.

|--------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Software Validation Form | Updated Software Validation Form |


### 1.4 Release

If validation was not successful:

 * Document the validation results in the list of computerized systems and classify the system as "blocked" /
   "not released for use".

If validation was successful:

 * Document the validation results and sign the validation report as part of the computerized system
   validation form.
 * Release the computerized system by adding it to the list of computerized systems.
 * Inform relevant staff about the approval of the system.

|                          | Notification sent                  |

### 1.5 Monitoring of Softwares

 * User feedback and error reports by developers are monitored for relevant occurrences that may affect the
   organization or its medical devices.
 * New version updates are implemented and the list of computerized systems is updated accordingly. If
   necessary, a revalidation is carried out.

### 1.6 Decommissioning of Software

 * In case it is decided to decommission a computerized system, evaluate possible effects and document the
   actions in the List of Software.
