# SOP Post-Market Surveillance

## Summary

This SOP describes how Post-Market Surveillance is performed for products. It ensures that new information
about safety and performance is proactively collected and can be used as input for the risk management,
clinical evaluation and software development of our products.

## General Considerations

This process is followed for each product separately, meaning that for each product, a Post-Market
Surveillance Plan and Report are created and continuously updated.

> Note: For class I devices, you could specify a longer update interval, e.g. once every two years.
> Note: Feel free to assign the responsibility to any other role. It typically makes sense to choose a role
> that is both close to product development as well as clinical issues.

| Responsibility  | Document Update Interval |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| Product Manager | Once per year            |

> Please also note that according to the Transitional Provisions of Art. 120 MDR, you are required to comply
> with MDR requirements regarding post-market surveillance (Art. 83 ff.) starting May 2021 even if your
> product runs on a valid MDD certificate. This basically means to use the new format of a ‘Period Safety
> Update Report’ (PSUR).

## Process Steps

### 1. Create Post-Market Surveillance Plan

Based on the clinical evaluation and technical documentation, a new Post-Market Surveillance Plan is created
for a product.

| Participants    |
|-----------------|
| QMO             |
| Product Manager |

| Input                  | Output                        |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Device Description     | Post-Market Surveillance Plan |
| Clinical Evaluation    |                               |
| Risk Management Report |                               |

### 2. Conduct Post-Market Surveillance

The Post-Market Surveillance is carried out as described in the Post-Market Surveillance Plan in the defined
interval.

The responsible employees continuously collect information from all the categories described below and
enter them into the report template.

At minimum, the following information categories have to be taken into consideration:

 * **Clinical evaluations and PMCF activities:**: Input from Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up activities.
 * **New research and development in the market:** Information regarding similar medical devices and
   technologies on the market.
 * **Input from recalls and reportable events:** Recalls, incidents and unintended side effects reported by
   competitors, similar products and procedures or reported for other devices of our company (e.g. check BfArM
   / FDA databases as further specified in the post-market surveillance plan; also see vigilance process).
 * **New or updated norms and standards, directives, regulation and other laws:** Verification if the list of
   applicable regulations is up to date.
 * **SOUP:** Verification if SOUP list is up to date.
 * **Complaints directly reported by customers:** Information gathered through customer feedback and
   complaints (see process for feedback management).
 * **Other feedback** collected or reported by sales or marketing staff, distributors, or other stakeholders.

For each part of information, it is assessed whether it is applicable to the company's product. Additionally,
the severity of impact on device safety and performance is rated on the following scale:

 * **Severe:** Serious injury or death
 * **Moderate:** Non-serious injury
 * **Marginal:** Everything else, less than moderate

Depending on the applicability, severity and observed trends of the new information, appropriate actions are
initiated. The QMO and the Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (PRRC) must be consulted in this step, other roles (e.g. medical
staff) should be involved if needed.

Actions may entail:

 * **Updating the product risk management file**, for example, by adding new risks according to our risk
   management process, updating occurrence / severity assumptions made for risks we already documented or
   updating risk mitigation measures in place).
 * **Initiating a CAPA**, for example, to update processes, training measures or resource allocation.
 * **Initiating the vigilance process** reporting serious incidents and FSCA to competent authorities.
 * **Design changes** to the product following the company’s change management process.

| Input                                | Output                |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Post-Market Surveillance Plan        | Evaluated Information |
| Post-Market Surveillance Information |                       |

### 3. Compile Periodic Safety Update Report

The Product Manager finalizes the Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR), which is at least reviewed by the
Person Responsible for Regulatory Compliance (PRRC). The report should contain at least the following information:

 * main findings of post-market surveillance activities throughout the surveillance interval
 * conclusion regarding implications for the risk management and clinical evaluation of the product, in
   particular, the overall residual risk and benefit-risk determination
 * the sales volume of the device, e.g. amount of users and, where practicable, the usage frequency of the
   device.
