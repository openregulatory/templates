# Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR)

This report describes product-specific post-market surveillance activity output as outlined in the Post-Market
Surveillance Plan.

## 1. Executive Summary

> Describe the main results of the current PSUR and provide background information so that the PSUR “stands
> alone”. Executive summary should provide a clear and bold statement declaring whether the benefit risk ratio
> has been negatively impacted based on the information reported within the current PSUR. This statement
> should be added after the conclusions of the PSUR have been completed.

## 2. Purpose and Scope of the PSUR

This Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) applies to [Device Name] and summarizes the results and conclusions
of the analyses of the post-market surveillance data. Furthermore, this report provides a rationale and
description of any preventive and corrective actions taken.

### 3.1 Intended Use

> Add intended use.

### 3.2 Patient Population

> Add patient population

### 3.3 Intended Medical Indication

> Add intended medical indication

### 3.4 Contraindications

> If none, state as follows: There are no known specific situations that contraindicate the use of this device.

### 3.5 Operating Principle

> Offer a detailed overview of the device, encompassing its name, models, sizes, and components across
> hardware, software, and accessories. Clearly categorize the device, such as a biological artificial aortic
> valve, and outline its physical and chemical attributes, technical specifications, and mechanical
> traits. Specify sterilization methods, radioactivity considerations, and operational principles. Detail
> materials used, particularly those in contact with the patient, and any inclusion of medicinal substances,
> animal tissues, or blood components. Incorporate a visual representation, and note the device's class,
> global market entry, and specific product configurations. Highlight innovative features relevant to ongoing
> assessments and address unmet medical needs. Provide concise step-by-step application procedures, elucidate
> performance in different modes, and describe the device's workflow.

### 3.6 User Profile

> Describe the typical user of the software. Some ideas could be: Qualifications, prior training (for your
> software), technical proficiency, time spent using the software.

### 3.7 User Environment Including Hardware / Software

> Describe the typical use environment. What sort of devices is this running on? Does the software only run on
> one device or multiple devices? Is it loud and chaotic like in an emergency ward? How’s the lighting? Also,
> add other software or hardware which is required by your device. Most commonly, apps require users to have a
> smartphone with a compatible operating system (iOS / Android).

### 3.8 Characteristics of the Population using the Device

> Describe the observed usage of the device in different patient populations in comparison to the expected
> usage and identify the possible over-represented or under-represented patient groups.

### 3.9 Volume of Sales

> Provide an accurate information on the number of devices sold and the possible changes on it. The data
> should be presented by year to year. Provide also further information on the volume of sales in respect to
> the various sizes, models and system components of the device.

## 4. Summary of PMS Activities

### 4.1 Feedbackback and Complaints

#### 4.1.1 Serious incidents

> Summarize all serious incidents and describe the influence on the risk management and the risk benefit
> evaluation.

#### 4.1.2 Non-Serious incidents and expected undesirable side effects

> Summarize all non-serious incidents and describe the influence on the risk management and the risk benefit
> evaluation.

#### 4.1.3 Proactively gathered feedback

> Summarize the activities and findings, any consequences on risk management and/or clinical evaluation,
> including any follow-up activity.

### 4.2 Trend identification and reporting

> Summarize information on any detected trends for non-serious incidents or expected undesirable
> side-effects. Summarize the activities and findings, including the reporting to the regulatory authority and
> any required follow-up activity.

### 4.3 Technical & Specialist Literature

> Summarize information coming from specialist or technical literature, such as regulations, directives,
> guidance document updates, common specifications, product standards, specialist journals, etc.

### 4.4 Information about Similar Devices

> Summarize information coming from publicly available sources and channels for complaints or other experience
> databases on equivalent/similar devices (such as FDA MAUDE, MHRA, Swissmedic, Implant Registries, etc.).

### 4.5 Summary of FSCA Documentation

> Summarize the information on field safety and corrective actions.

## 5. Main findings from PMCF Activities

### 5.1 List of PMCF Studies

> Summaries all ongoing and plannend PMCF studies.

### 5.2 Systematic Literature Research

> Reference the CER or provide a summary of the literature search.

## 6. Information from previous PSURs

> Information from the previous PSUR / PMSR (if available) to identify pending actions during that reporting
> periods.

## 7. Change of the State of the Art

> Describe whether there is any change of the device state of the art when compared with the evaluation from
> the current Clinical Evaluation Report.

## 8. Risk Management & Benefit-Risk Assessment

> Potential failure modes (hazards) and harms related to use of the Device Name/Group have been identified,
> assessed and controlled during development according to EN ISO 14971:2019. No new hazards and harms were
> identified as a result of the PMS activities conducted during the present review period, and no update of
> the risk management file has been made due to safety and performance issues.

> In conclusion, the results referred to above demonstrate a continuous acceptability of the benefit-risk
> determination of the Device Name/Group , i.e. the risks associated with use of the device are still
> outweighed by the benefits of the device.

## 9. Required Updates to PMS Plan

> Describe the plannend updates of the PMS plan.
