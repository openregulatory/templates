# Post-Market Surveillance Plan

This plan describes product-specific post-market surveillance activities. The general process of how to do
post-market surveillance is described in SOP Post-Market Surveillance. Its outputs are saved to the
Post-Market Surveillance Report.

## Product

| Product Name            | Version       | Surveillance Period        |
|-------------------------|---------------|----------------------------|
| *\<your product name\>* | *\<version\>* | *\<e.g. 10/2020-10/2021\>* |


## 1. General Considerations

> Note: Whatever kind of post-market surveillance activities you define for your product, make sure to map at
> minimum all of these actions required by the MDR to one activity in section 2 below.

According to Annex III section 1.1 (b) MDR, the post-market surveillance plan shall cover:

 * SOUP Incident Reports
   * Go through SOUP list
   * Research public incident reports of the last (enter time span) months

> Make sure to not just update your clinical evaluation here and enter the same keywords as for the literature review.
> Also add keywords for the equivalent / similar devices you compare (such as their brand names).

### Other information about similar devices

 * Google News Search
   * Filter: (define)
   * Time span:
 * (...)

### Specialist literature / technical databases

> Note: This chapter should analyze other publications applicable to our product which are not considered
> already (or typically) as part of the post-market clinical follow-up.

 * Pubmed
   * Filter: (define)
   * Time span: last 12 months
 * (...)

### Serious incidents of our medical device

 * Incident documentation
   * Was the device involved in any event that caused, directly or indirectly, death of a patient, user or
     other person or to a serious deterioration in their state of health? Did the company issue a recall of
     the device?
   * If so, attach respective documentation (e.g. field safety notices)
   * Time span:

### Non-serious incidents and undesirable side effects of our own medical device

 * Feedback and customer complaints
   * Filter: hazard-related feedback, usability issues
   * Time span:

### Feedback we collect from our partners, users, distributors, importers

 * Feedback and customer complaints
   * Filter: not hazard-related feedback, feedback on performance, safety or processes
   * Time span:

The overall complaint rate is deemed acceptable if:
* Less than 10% of complaints are associated with moderate severity of harm or higher
* Overall number of complaints does not exceed 10% of total active users
* (...)

> Note: customize the acceptance criteria for the overall complaint rate to your setup

### Trends

 * Compile a list of trends as described in the section below.

## 4. Trend Analysis

Trend analysis is performed with a focus on undesirable side-effects and non-serious incidents. These will be
monitored if they impact the benefit-risk ratio in a negative way.

Hazards in the risk table are compared to post-market surveillance results:

 * If post-market surveillance leads to the finding that the estimated **probability** was too low (= event
   happened more often in post-market surveillance), actions are initiated as described in the SOP Post-Market
   Surveillance.
 * If post-market surveillance leads to the finding that the estimated **severity** was too low (= event
   happened led to more serious harm in post-market surveillance), a CAPA is initiated.
