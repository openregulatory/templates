# Post-Market Surveillance Plan

This plan describes product-specific post-market surveillance activities. The general process of how to do
post-market surveillance is described in SOP Post-Market Surveillance. Its outputs are saved to the
Post-Market Surveillance Report or the Periodic Safety Update Report.

> Note: Whatever kind of post-market surveillance activities you define for your product, make sure to map at
> minimum all of these actions required by the MDR to one activity in section 2 below.

According to Annex III section 1.1 (b) MDR, the post-market surveillance plan shall cover:

## 3. Methods and Procedures

> Include mandatory data sources in the PMS plan for each product, with additional methods based on risk class
> and product type. Justify any non-applicability.

### 3.1 Feedback

### Serious Incidents and FSCA

The insert report type, e.g. PMS Report or PSUR will summarize the number of reported serious incidents, their
investigation results and any taken subsequent measures.

### Non-serious Incidents and Expected Undesirable Side-Effects

The PMS Report or PSUR will summarize the evaluation results and conclusions, including any taken preventive
or corrective actions.

### Proactively gathered Feedback

Proactively collect feedback from distributors, users, and importers, including inputs not considered in
previous sections. This encompasses feedback on usability, both positive and regarding issues, gathered
through client visits, conferences, and events. General market feedback will also be actively obtained during
client visits, conferences, fairs, and specified events. Specify objectives, acceptance criteria, and
responsible persons for these activities. The aim is to identify new risks, verify existing ones, and assess
benefits and use-related aspects of the medical device. Evaluate and summarize the gathered information. If
potential serious incidents arise, follow the SOP Vigilance. The PMS Report or PSURwill summarize the results.

### 3.2 Trend Identification and Reporting

According to the MDR, Article 88 non-serious incidents and expected undesirable side-effects are subject to
trend analysis. Statistically significant increases in the frequency or severity will be reported.  There are
three types of changes that can be indicated by a trend analysis:

* a sudden significant deviation like an outlier or spike, respectively;
* significant trends, i.e. repetitive deviations or continuous drifting away from the history of earlier
  values;
* detection by visual inspection, whether the data are subject to cyclic effects, e.g. of calendar events like
  summer holidays or end of budget periods.

All incidents deemed non-serious and anticipated undesirable side-effects will undergo meticulous
documentation and categorization, encompassing occurrences such as the arrival of a non-sterile device or a
software crash. This process is crucial for maintaining a standardized approach, ensuring comparability across
different incidents. To achieve this, normalization will be applied, factoring in the respective sales numbers
or the number of installed devices per month.

The data obtained will be graphically represented for each incident category, portraying the number of
normalized incidents against the corresponding month. This visualization serves to illuminate the temporal
progression of these incidents over time, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of trends and
patterns. Adhering to the guidelines outlined in ISO/TR 20416 for Medical Devices - PMS for manufacturers,
Rule 3 of the Nelson Rules will be employed to detect trends. A trend is detected, where six or more points in
a row exhibit a continuous upward trajectory. In addition, long term trends are detected by visual inspection
and review of the plotted incidents. If a trend is detected, a CAPA will be opened to investigate the
incidents.

### 3.3. Databases and Registers

> Specify applicable literature databases, e.g. PubMed, Embase, COCHRANE, etc. for the gathering of clinical
> data. If you have a separate PMCF plan which already contains the literature search as one of the planned
> PMCF activities, you may provide a brief statement that there is a search strategy for literature in the
> PMCF plan.

### SOUP Incident Reports

Check device SOUP list and research incident reports from last 12 months.

### Technical, Specialist & Regulatory Information

Applicable literature are product standards and guidelines as documented in the checklist of General Safety
and Performance Requirements according to Annex I of Regulation (EU) 2017/745. These serve to determine the
current state of the art and possible technical improvements and will be monitored on a yearly basis for
changes and renewals. Furthermore, the Medical Device Coordination Group (MDCG) publications (guidance
documents) will be reviewed with regards to guidance on interpretation of process- or product-relevant
interpretations of regulatory requirements in the Regulation (EU) 2017/745. The < PMS Report or PSUR\> will
summarize the results.

### Other Publicly Available Information about Similar Medical Devices

Identify the databases to be utilized for investigating incidents and recalls related to comparable devices
(e.g., through MAUDE, BfArM, MHRA). Clearly outline the similar devices and establish appropriate search and
evaluation criteria. A sample approach is provided below:

| Database      | BfArM                                                    |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Criteria:     | Safety Information (Safety warnings, alerts and recalls) |
| Timeframe:    | January 1 – December 31 2020                             |
| Search terms: | E.g. Similar Device Name                                 |

### 3.4. PMCF

> If PMCF is exempt, add a justification.
>
> PMCF may only be exempt under one of the two following conditions:
>
> The demonstration of conformity with general safety and performance requirements based on clinical data is
> not deemed appropriate, and adequate justification for the non-applicability of a clinical evaluation report
> has been given; or It is a product without an intended medical purpose (see Annex XVI of Regulation (EU)
> 2017/745).
>
> Otherwise:
>
> A PMCF plan has been developed for this device to consistently collect relevant clinical data, confirming
> the benefit-risk determination in the Risk Management Report and Clinical Evaluation Report. This includes
> assessing clinical safety, performance, any claims, and its alignment with the current state of the art. The
> specific PMCF activities are contingent on factors such as device innovation, the availability of adequate
> clinical data, inherent risks, and device type. These considerations have guided the planning of suitable
> PMCF methods.

## 4. Planned PMS Report/ Periodic Safety Update Report \(PSUR\)

> Please state the month and year of the planned PMS report (for Class I devices)/ of the PSUR (for all other
> devices).
