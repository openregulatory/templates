See IAU - Internal Audit Plan section 4 and copy the audit schedule here.

## 4. Methodology

During the audit, the auditor gathered, using appropriate sampling, information relating to the audit
objectives, scope and criteria, including information relating to the interfaces between functions, activities
and processes, and verified it. Only verifiable information constituted audit evidence. Audit evidence leading
to audit findings was recorded.

Relevant documentation from the auditee was reviewed in order to:

* Determine the compliance of the system, based on the available documentation, with the audit criteria, and to
* Gather the information necessary to support audit activities.

In addition, information related to the audited process was gathered through interviews of the auditees by the
auditors.

## 5. Classification of Non-Conformities

The classification of audit findings is established as follows:

* **Major Non-Conformity (MNC):** A deviation in the system, practices and processes that could result in
  significant effects that violate the law, patient safety or well-being, or could result in a public health
  risk or indicates a major deviation from current regulations.
* **Minor Non-Conformity (mNC):** A deviation in the system, practices and processes that is not expected to
  result in an adverse effect on the safety or well-being of patients.
* **Opportunities for Improvement (OFI):** A commentary indicating a process for improvement either by
  improving quality or reducing the occurrence of deviations.
