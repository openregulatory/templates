# Performance Evaluation Plan (IVDD)

The Performance Evaluation Plan lays out the resources and methods for the evaluation of the performance of the IVD.

> There's a separate standard available for that: EN 13612:2002. It's very short and doesn't contain a whole
> lot of information. You can generally understand what it's about when you look at the mapping of
> requirements to document sections table below. Additionally, there are three IMDRF guidance documents which
> are more relevant for the Performance Evaluation Report:
>
> * [GHTF/SG5/N6:2012][imdrf-1]
> * [GHTF/SG5/N7:2012][imdrf-2]
> * [GHTF/SG5/N8:2012][imdrf-3]

## 5. Responsibilities and Resources

### 5.1 Personnel

> These five tasks are explicitly specified in EN 13612, so you should assign them to someone. Feel free to
> add further tasks if you have any. Of course, one person can take care of multiple tasks.

| Task                                                                    | Personnel       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Coordinator with overall responsibility                                 | John Doe        |
| Assess the validity of test results and data already available          | John Doe Jr.    |
| Specify performance claims which shall be further examined or confirmed | John Doe Sr.    |
| Specify and document the evaluation plan and the test procedures        | John Doe II     |
| Prepare the evaluation report                                           | Albert Einstein |

### 5.2 Resources

> Describe other resources which you need for performance evaluation, e.g. software and hardware, physical
> locations.

## 6. Performance Claims of IVD MD

> For each performance claim, assess whether it's applicable to your IVD, i.e. can you measure that specific
> parameter, based on your device output? Then, add an explanation about what those parameters actually mean
> in the context of your device.
>
> An example could be that you're manufacturing an HIV test. Then, analytical sensitivity is applicable, and
> your explanation would be something like "proportion of HIV-positive patients who have positive test
> results".

| Performance Claim      | Applicable? | Explanation |
|------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Analytical Sensitivity | yes/no      |             |
| Diagnostic Sensitivity |             |             |
| Analytical Specificity |             |             |
| Diagnostic Specificity |             |             |
| Accuracy               |             |             |
| Repeatability          |             |             |
| Reproducibility        |             |             |

## 7. Evaluation Procedure

### 7.1 List of Laboratories and Other Institutions Taking Part in Study

> List the labs which take part in your study. If your product is for self-testing, list the "lay persons" who
> are your study participants.

### 7.2 Time Table

> Create some sort of timeline when to do what.

| Date | Activity                            |
|------|-------------------------------------|
|      | Plan Performance Evaluation         |
|      | Conduct Performance Evaluation      |
|      | Write Performance Evaluation Report |

### 7.3 Briefing of Investigators

> If your investigators (the people who conduct the study) aren't familiar with your device, describe how
> you'll provide them with the necessary information beforehand.

### 7.4 Software Validation

The device is stand-alone software and will be validated in accordance with IEC 62366-1:2015, see SOP
Integrated Software Development.

### 7.5 Performance Study Records

> Describe how and where records of your performance study will be saved. Those could be files which contain
> your analysis data, or even the input data (i.e., test set) which you used for it.

### 7.6 Observations and Unexpected Outcomes

> Describe what you'll do when an unexpected outcome happens. Might not apply to stand-alone software.

### 8. Re-Evaluation

> Specify under which conditions your performance evaluation will be repeated. That's mainly the case when you
> change your device.

### 9. Protection and Safety of Probands

> Describe how you ensure the safety of your probands. Probably not be applicable to software in most cases.

## 10. Dates and Signatures

> Date and sign the plan. If your document management system supports it, you can digitally sign by typing
> e.g. your initials in the "Signature" field. Otherwise, you can still sign it the old-school way (print it
> and sign the sheet of paper, ugh).

| Activity | Name | Signature |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Creation  |      |           |
| Review    |      |           |
| Approval  |      |           |
