## 7. Clinical Evidence

Clinical evaluation is an on-going process, conducted throughout the life cycle of a MDSW. Both favorable and
unfavorable data considered in the clinical evaluation shall be included in the technical documentation.

Three key components will be taken into account when compiling clinical evidence:

**Valid clinical association**

* Demonstrate that it corresponds to the clinical situation, condition, indication or parameter defined in the
  intended purpose of the MDSW

**Technical performance**

* Demonstration of the MDSW’s ability to accurately, reliably and precisely generate the intended output, from
  the input data.

**Clinical performance**

* Demonstration of a MDSW’s ability to yield clinically relevant output in accordance with the intended purpose

### 7.1 Valid Clinical Association

Valid clinical association is understood as the extent to which, the MDSW’s output (e.g. concept, conclusion,
calculations) based on the inputs and algorithms selected, is associated with the targeted physiological state
or clinical condition. This association should be well founded or clinically accepted. The valid clinical
association of a MDSW should demonstrate that it corresponds to the clinical situation, condition, indication
or parameter defined in the intended purpose of the MDSW.

> Example: MDSW that detects heart arrhythmia by analysing auscultation sound obtained by a digital
> stethoscope requires demonstrating valid clinical association of the association between abnormal cardiac
> sounds and heart arrhythmia. Evidence supporting valid clinical association can be generated e.g. through
> literature research, professional guidelines, proof of concept studies, or manufacturer’s own clinical
> investigations/clinical performance studies.
>
> The is intended to […]. This is a well-established clinical procedure and clinically accepted.
> The valid clinical association will be demonstrated with:
>
> * Technical standards
> * Professional medical society guidelines
> * Systematic scientific literature review
> * Clinical investigations
> * Published clinical data (e.g. Summary of Safety and Clinical Performance (SSCP) / Summary of Safety and
>   Performance (SSP), Registries and databases from authorities)

### 7.2 Technical Performance

> According to the MDCG 2020-1 technical performance is the demonstration of the MDSW’s ability to accurately,
> reliably and precisely generate the intended output, from the input data. Evidence supporting technical
> performance can be generated through verification and validation activities, e.g. unit-level, integration,
> and system testing or by generating new evidence through use of curated databases, curated registries,
> reference databases or use of previously collected patient data.
>
> Technical performance is confirmed by the examination and provision of objective evidence that the MDSW
> specifications conform to user needs and intended uses, and that the requirements implemented can be
> consistently fulfilled. For example, performance verification and validation in the intended computing and
> use environments can be characterized by the demonstration of:
>
> * availability,
> * confidentiality,
> * integrity,
> * reliability,
> * accuracy (resulting from trueness and precision),
> * analytical sensitivity,
> * limit of detection,
> * limit of quantitation,
> * analytical specificity,
> * linearity,
> * cut-off value(s),
> * measuring interval (range),
> * GENERALISABILITY,
> * expected data rate or quality,
> * absence of inacceptable cybersecurity vulnerabilities,
> * HUMAN FACTORS ENGINEERING.
>
> Summarize the relevant tests, validations and verifications to demonstrate that the medical deviceaccurately
> and consistently meets the intended purpose in real-world usage. Add subchapter if necessary.

### 7.3 Clinical performance

> Validation of the CLINICAL PERFORMANCE is the demonstration of a MDSW’s ability to yield clinically relevant
> output in accordance with the intended purpose. The clinical relevance of a MDSW’s output is a positive
> impact on the health of an individual expressed in terms of measurable, patient-relevant clinical
> outcome(s), including outcome(s) related to diagnosis, prediction of risk, prediction of treatment
> response(s), or related to its function, such as that of screening, monitoring, diagnosis or aid to
> diagnosis of patients, oron patient management or public health. Example for clinical performance is a
> retrospective study on previously obtained data. Generate evidence that shows your:SaMD has been tested in
> your target population and for your intended use; and that users can achieve clinically meaningful outcomes
> through predictable and reliable use.
>
> Note that line with the provisions of MDR Article 61 (1), the level of clinical evidence required should be
> appropriate in view of the device claims and characteristics. For medical devices, where the demonstration
> of conformity with GSPRs based on clinical data is not deemed appropriate (MDR Article 61 (10)), the
> manufacturer shall duly substantiate in the technical documentation why it is adequate to demonstrate
> conformity based on the results of non-clinical testing methods alone, bench testing and preclinical
> evaluation, and usability assessment.
>
> This means in case where your device does not produce clinical data, you can use bench testing and usability
> to demonstrate the clinical performance.
>
> Summarize the clinical performance data.

#### 7.3.1 Equivalent device

> If no equivalence is claimed: No equivalent device could be identified.
>
> General guidance including a detailed comparison table is provided in the MDCG 2020-05. Read this guidance
> and use the table to demonstrate equivalence if applicable.
