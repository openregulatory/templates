# Checklist: Clinical Evaluation Report

## 1. Summary

Herein, we verify the completeness and consistency of the release of the Clinical Evaluation Report with the
requirements stated in Appendix A10 of the MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 Guideline.

> This checklist is actually copy-pasted from the Appendix A10 of the MEDDEV 2.7/1 revision 4 Guideline.
>
> This template is the bare minimum to ensure that your Clinical Evaluation Report is compliant with the
> requirements for the initial CE-marking and follows the key points the notified bodies in the EU will assess
> your Clinical Evaluation Report for. Feel free to add further rows and / or adapt the current ones in the
> checklist if they make sense for your SaMD. Make sure to fill it out before you continue working on other
> technical documentation of your SaMD especially post-market surveillance and risk assessment-related
> activities.
