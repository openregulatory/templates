# Clinical Evaluation Plan

The Clinical Evaluation Plan defines methods for creating and updating the Clinical Evaluation Report. This
plan is updated later by the post-market clinical follow-up, e.g. to include new search criteria for the
literature search.

> While the content of the Clinical Evaluation is simple, writing it, coming up with the right structure and
> forming a sensible line of reasoning (equivalence) can be a bit tricky.
>
> These are the guidance documents on Clinical Evaluation. If you're the person writing it, you should read
> them:
>
>  * MDCG 2020-1, 2020-5, 2020-6
>  * MDCG 2020-13: Quite helpful as it gives you an idea of the structure.
>  * MEDDEV 2.7.1 rev. 4. (mostly for MDD, but still a good starting point; especially the list of proposed
>    headings for a report at the end of the document).

## 2. Scope of the Clinical Evaluation

> Note: This section will be copy-pasted into the Clinical Evaluation Report

### 2.1 Device Description

> Copy-paste your Device Description (which includes the Intended Use) here. If it's not done yet, remember to
> do it later :)

### 2.2 Clinical Benefits, Outcome Parameters

> Describe the clinical benefits you expect from your product. Define how you'll measure those (outcome
> parameters). You'll probably be planning to do a literature search to prove them - as you know the
> literature, it makes sense to select outcome parameters which were already established in prior studies.

> Also describe the product claims as stated by MEDDEV 2/7.1 Rev. 4, as stated there:
> Medical device claims results from general requirements on safety and performance. These claims are part of
> materials (e. g. IFU, marketing material and other accompanying documents). These product claims will be
> checked within the clinical evaluation and evidence are made. e.g.
>
> * diagnosis for better treatment decision (performance)
> * xy % accuracy, xy % sensitivity, xy % specificity

### 2.3 Clinical Safety, Methods for Analysis

> Describe your safety parameters, i.e. which things should your product fulfil so that you consider it safe?
> And your methods, i.e. how will you prove that your product fulfils those safety parameters? A method could
> be a literature search for past studies, but you could additionally do a Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up to
> double-check whether that's actually true for your device.

### 2.4 Acceptability of Benefit-Risk Ratio

> After you've defined your benefits and safety parameters, which combination of those is acceptable to you?
> In the case of most software devices (and apps), you'll probably have subtle benefits (e.g. better disease
> management, early detection of relapses) while low safety concerns (e.g. disease progression unlikely, not
> killing anyone).

## 3. Type of Evaluation

> Describe the type of Clinical Evaluation you'll be doing. In 99% of cases as a startup, you'll be claiming
> equivalence to an already-certified (CE marked) device. You'll have some methodology for searching for such
> a device. If you need some inspiration, check out the FDA 510k database for FDA-approved devices which claim
> equivalence to an already-certified device. Those are usually good to compare clinical and technical
> features and demonstrate equivalence :)

> And based on that, you'll be doing a literature search to come up with adequate clinical data.

## 4. Literature Search

### 4.1 Literature Search Methods

> Describe your literature search methods: The databases you'll be using (PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane,
> Embase), the keywords you'll be entering and how you plan to document it (you'll be creating a table, I
> suppose).

> I blindly copy-pasted some semi-helpful bullet points from guidance documents here:
> * The adequacy of search terms: for example, it should be sufficiently broad to establish benchmarks,
>   determine the general state of the art, determine potential risk, adverse events, undesirable side-effects,
>   etc.
> * Note that a search which is restricted to the manufacturer’s own product or the name of their chosen
>   equivalent could miss important information and therefore is not acceptable.
> * Databases used (to minimize bias multiple databases should be used).
> * Acceptability of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
> * Both favourable and unfavourable data are included.
> * Strategies for avoiding duplication of data (for example, across different publications or between
>   the manufacturer and published data).
> * Literature search and review protocol (i.e. how did the manufacturer test this protocol to ensure
>   comprehensive identification of relevant data / demonstrate that all relevant data has been retrieved?).
> * Any deviations from the manufacturer’s literature search protocol.
> * Overall conclusions regarding the adequacy of search methods, the likelihood of having retrieved all relevant
>   data, and methods used to avoid bias.

> It makes sense to differentiate between "context" and "pivotal" data:
> * Context data describes the state of the art (commonly the introduction / literature part of papers)
> * Pivotal data is used for the appraisal, i.e. that's the data describing the actual study and
>   outcome(s). In the best case, the pivotal data is about the actual device you're claiming equivalence to.

### 4.2 Literature Appraisal Criteria

> Describe your criteria for clinical data which you deem acceptable for your clinical evaluation. Firstly, the
> information should be relevant, secondly, you'll probably have some additional hard criteria, like
> requirements for the study design etc.
>
> Also: How will you weigh the information from multiple studies?

> You can evaluate the appraisal of pivotal data by considering the equivalence of the described device
> literature (e.g. material & methods part, algorithm, models); the level of evidence can be taken from
> different sources (LoE of American heart association or quality of clinical data according to MDCG Guideline
> 2020-6).

### 4.3 Additional Databases

> You can also check out additional databases for relevant data and mention how you search them:
> * Clinical trials: clinicaltrail.gov, DRKS, WHO, ANZCTR
> * Adverse events: EUDAMED (if it works), FDA MAUDE, FDA Medical Device Recalls
