# Clinical Evaluation Plan

The Clinical Evaluation Plan defines methods for creating and updating the Clinical Evaluation Report. This
plan is updated later by the post-market clinical follow-up, e.g., to include new search criteria for the
literature search.

> While the content of the Clinical Evaluation is simple, writing it, coming up with the right structure and
> forming a sensible line of reasoning (equivalence) can be a bit tricky.
>
> These are the guidance documents on Clinical Evaluation. If you're the person writing it, you should read
> them:
>
> * MDCG 2020-1, 2020-5, 2020-6
> * MDCG 2020-13: Quite helpful as it gives you an idea of the structure.
> * MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev. 4. (mostly for MDD, but still a good starting point; especially the list of proposed
>   headings for a report at the end of the document).
>
> Optionally:
> * IMDRF/SaMD WG/N41 FINAL:2017
> * IMDRF MDCE WG/N55 FINAL:2019
> * IMDRF MDCE WG/N56 FINAL:2019
> * IMDRF MDCE WG/N57 FINAL:2019

## 1. Scope of the Clinical Evaluation

> Note: This section will be copy-pasted into the Clinical Evaluation Report

Based on MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4, the Clinical Evaluation is performed in five logical procedural stages in order
to evaluate the performance and safety data of the medical device:

* Step 0 (“Scope”)
* Step 1 (“Identification”)
* Step 2 (“Appraisal”)
* Step 3 (“Analysis”)
* Step 4 (“Report”)

## Device

### 2.1 Device Description

> Copy-paste your Device Description here, which includes the Intended Use but also, User Profile,
> Precautions/Safety Instructions, Contraindications, Use Environment, Operating Principle,
> Variants/Accessories, Novelty, Design Requirements. If it's not done yet, remember to
> do it later :)

### 2.2 Clinical Benefits, Outcome Parameters

> Describe the clinical benefits you expect from your product. Define how you'll measure those (i.e., outcome
> parameters). You'll probably be planning to do a literature search to prove them. As you know the
> literature, it makes sense to select outcome parameters which were already established in prior studies.
> For example, if your website claims that your device cures back pain in 50% of patients after 14 days,
> here’s the place to list that claim and show and explain how you’ll prove it.

> Also, describe the product claims as stated by MEDDEV 2.7/1 Rev. 4:
> Medical device claims results from general requirements on safety and performance. These claims are part of
> materials (e.g. IFU, marketing material and other accompanying documents). These product claims will be
> checked within the clinical evaluation and evidence are made.
> Performance-related product claims:
> * Claim 1, e.g., diagnosis for better treatment decision (performance)
> * Claim 1, e.g., xy % accuracy, xy % sensitivity, xy % specificity

### 2.3 Clinical Safety, Methods for Analysis

> Describe your safety parameters, i.e., which things should your product fulfil so that you consider it safe?
> And your methods, i.e., how will you prove that your product fulfils those safety parameters? A method could
> be a literature search for past studies, but you could additionally do a Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up to
> double-check whether that's actually true for your device.

> For MD class I: does it replace the medical care chain? Is the case that only a doctor can diagnose causes
> or concomitant diseases in the case of occurring complaints and prescribe necessary therapies if needed?
> Are there any side effects expected? If however any side effects occur during the use, can the patient
> interrupt the process any time?
>
> Also, make sure to mention that a risk management plan, risk assessment and risk management report were
> undertaken according to the EN ISO 14971:2019 to evaluate all the known and foreseeable risks related to the
> product.

> Safety-related product claims:
> * Claim 1, e.g., temporary worsening
> * Claim 2, e.g., placebo effect

### 2.4 Acceptability of Benefit-Risk Ratio

> After you've defined your benefits and safety parameters, which combination of those is acceptable to you?
> In the case of most software devices (and apps), you'll probably have subtle benefits (e.g., better disease
> management, early detection of relapses) while low safety concerns (e.g., disease progression unlikely, not
> killing anyone).

## 3. Type of Evaluation

> Describe the type of Clinical Evaluation you'll be doing. Most probably, you'll be doing a literature
> search to come up with adequate clinical data.

## 4. Literature Search

### 4.1 Literature Search Methods

> Describe your literature search methods, the databases you'll be using (PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane,
> Embase), the keywords you'll be entering and how you plan to document it (you'll be creating a table, I
> suppose).

> Comment if systematic search and review methods such as the following have been used:
> * PICO (patient characteristics, type of intervention, control, and outcome queries).
> * Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
> * PRISMA (The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement.
> * MOOSE Proposal (Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology).
> * Other (specify or describe).

> I blindly copy-pasted some semi-helpful bullet points from guidance documents here:
> * The adequacy of search terms: for example, it should be sufficiently broad to establish benchmarks,
>   determine the general state of the art, determine potential risk, adverse events, undesirable side effects,
>   etc.
> * Note that a search which is restricted to the manufacturer’s own product or the name of their chosen
>   equivalent could miss important information and therefore is not acceptable.
> * Databases used (to minimize bias multiple databases should be used).
> * Acceptability of inclusion and exclusion criteria.
> * Both favourable and unfavourable data are included.
> * Strategies for avoiding duplication of data (for example, across different publications or between
>   the manufacturer and published data).
> * Literature search and review protocol (i.e., how did the manufacturer test this protocol to ensure
>   comprehensive identification of relevant data / demonstrate that all relevant data has been retrieved?).
> * Any deviations from the manufacturer’s literature search protocol.
> * Overall conclusions regarding the adequacy of search methods, the likelihood of having retrieved all
>   relevant data, and methods used to avoid bias.

> It makes sense to differentiate between "context" and "pivotal" data:
> * Context data describes the state of the art (commonly the introduction / literature part of papers)
> * Pivotal data is used for the appraisal, i.e., that's the data describing the actual study and
>   outcome(s). In the best case, the pivotal data is about the device(s) you're claiming similarity to.

### 4.2 Literature Appraisal Criteria

> Describe your criteria for clinical data which you deem acceptable for your clinical evaluation. Firstly, the
> information should be relevant. Secondly, you'll probably have some additional hard criteria, like
> requirements for the study design etc.
>
> Also, how will you weigh the information from multiple studies?

> You can evaluate the appraisal of pivotal data by considering the equivalence of the described device
> literature (e.g., material & methods part, algorithm, models); the level of evidence can be taken from
> different sources (LoE of American Heart Association or quality of clinical data according to MDCG Guideline
> 2020-6).

### 4.3 Additional Databases (if applicable)

> You can also check out additional databases for relevant data and mention how you search them:
> * Clinical trials: clinicaltrail.gov, DRKS, WHO, ANZCTR
> * Adverse events: EUDAMED (if it works), FDA MAUDE, FDA Medical Device Recalls
