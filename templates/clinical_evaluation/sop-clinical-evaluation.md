## Summary

This SOP describes the development of medical devices in accordance with regulatory requirements of Annex XIV (MDR) regarding medical device clinical performance. It ensures the level of
demonstrated safety and risk-benefit ratio that is required for our medical devices both for initial
certification and for continued safe use in the market.

## Process Steps

### 1.1 Clinical Evaluation Plan

The clinical evaluation is initiated following a Management decision to place a new or updated medical device
on the market. The organization follows this process both for initial market placement and for continuous
updates during the marketing phase.

The initial clinical evaluation is planned as part of the Clinical Evaluation Plan. During the marketing
phase, this plan is continuously updated as part of the Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up.

External partners can be involved in both conducting the initial clinical evaluation and the post-market
clinical follow-up in order to ensure higher clinical expertise during the process and lower the risk of
regulatory nonconformity. In this case, different external partners should be evaluated with regard to
sufficient experience (see MEDDEV 2.7/1 rev. 4 section 6.2). The *\<Head of the Medical Team\>* serves as the
point of contact to provide all relevant information to the partner.

> NOTE: if your organization maintains a purchasing process, the selection of an external partner for the
> clinical evaluation should be subject to supplier evaluation.

| Output       | Initial release: completed Clinical Evaluation Plan                                                                                                                              |


### 1.2 Clinical Evaluation Report

Relevant data is collected and analyzed as part of writing the Clinical Evaluation Report to evaluate the
deviceâ€™s clinical performance. The clinical evaluation shall consider at least the following points:

* Intended Use (incl. user and patient population, use environment, device features)
* Data to support equivalence with other devices (if applicable)
* Discussion of state of the art technology
* Discussion of the selected categories of clinical data, the quality of clinical data and its sufficiency to
  support an overall balanced risk-benefit ratio of the device and compliance with the General Safety
  Performance Requirements (MDR).

In the course of data collection and analysis, new risks may be identified and are documented accordingly as
updates to the risk management file.

> NOTE: where a Notified Body is involved in the conformity assessment of the device and the Medical team
> identifies remaining uncertainty with regard to the sufficiency of the clinical data, the Notified Body can
> be contacted to discuss additional measures (e.g., as part of the post-market clinical follow-up) that ensure
> product conformity and approval.

| Output       | Completed Clinical Evaluation Report<br>If necessary: updated risk file |

### 1.3 Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up (PMCF)

Following the initial clinical evaluation, the organization plans the post-market clinical follow-up for the
medical device, ensuring its continuous safety and sufficient performance during the marketing phase. The PMCF
serves as input to regularly update the clinical evaluation.

The Medical team is responsible to compile and implement a Post-Marketing Clinical Follow-Up Plan, including
at minimum:

* Methodology for data collection and justification for selected methods
* Consideration of new data related to the risk management file, the claims discussed in the Clinical
  Evaluation Report or applicable regulations
* Specification of the PMCFP period (no longer than one year), including a time plan for PMCF activities and
  the next update of the clinical evaluation

The CAPA process must be initiated if new information collected as part of the PMCF activities indicates that
a balanced risk-benefit ratio and the safety of the device is in question.

All PMCF activities conducted per PMCF period are documented in a Post-Market Clinical Follow-Up Report.
