# Data Protection and Confidentiality Agreement

As part of your employment, you may be instructed to process personal data or potentially personal data that
has been entrusted to you in accordance with the data protection regulations. To that end, you are provided
with an overview of the regulations relevant to your obligation. Data which you have become aware of during
the performance of your duties must not be misused for your own or any other purposes. This obligation remains
in force even after the termination of your employment. Deliberate or negligent breaches can have legal
consequences.

Personal data is all information related to an identified or identifiable person. It may not be collected,
used, passed on or otherwise processed without authorization. Personal data may only be processed in line with
company instructions. In addition to instructions from a supervisor, the following are regarded as
instructions: documents of the company"s quality management system, other operational documentation, flow
charts, company agreements or employee manuals.

***

I, \<employee name\>

hereby commit to keep strictest confidentiality with respect to personal data and to process it exclusively
according to the instructions of \<enter company name\>. I hereby further commit to keep strictest
confidentiality with respect to the personal data I shall collect, process, or access in the scope of my
activities for \<enter company name\>, and to refrain from disclosing them to any other natural or legal
person, including other employees of \<enter company name\>, unless disclosure is explicitly authorized by
instructions of the employer, contract or law, or unless disclosure is necessary to fulfill the instructions
of \<enter company name\>.

For instance, I am not allowed to use mobile data media, take printed copies home with me, or pass on personal
passwords to third parties. Further instructions on what has to be observed in terms of data protection law
can be found, inter alia, in:

* The company"s technical and organizational measures
* Company forms on employee obligations with regards to the handling of hardware
* The company"s list of data processing activities
* \<add anything else relevant here, e.g. authorization concept for software systems\>

This non-disclosure and confidentiality obligation continues to apply even after my employment with \<enter
company name\> has ended.

I am aware that any infringement against this obligation or of applicable data protection law such as Art. 83
of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), §§ 42 and 43 of the German Federal Data Protection
Act ("Bundesdatenschutzgesetz", BDSG) or other applicable European or national legal provisions may result in
serious fines, monetary or prison sentences and may possibly cause damage to natural or legal persons,
including the employer. In addition, infringement against this obligation may also constitute a breach of
obligations under the employment contract or of specific obligations for confidentiality and may, for example,
lead to a formal warning, a termination in due time or without notice or to an obligation to pay for
compensation. Legal consequences of a breach can also entail claims for damages against me personally by the
persons to whom such data refers. In these cases, I may be liable without limitation with all my assets and
without the possibility of residual debt discharge in the course of insolvency proceedings. Other obligations
of secrecy, such as those arising from the employment contract, continue to exist alongside this obligation.

I have read and understood this obligation to maintain confidentiality and to comply with data protection
regulations:

\<Place, date and signature of employee\>\
\<Place, date and signature of supervisor\>

I confirm that I have been informed about the meaning and relevance of this data protection obligation. I have
been given the opportunity to receive a copy of this form as well as further information on data protection
and the text of Art. 29 GDPR, Art. 83 para. 4 - 6 GDPR, Art. 42 para. 1 and 2 BDSG and Art. 43 para. 1 and 2
BDSG.

## Annex: Further information on data protection

* **Processing** within the EU General Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO) means any process or series of
  operations performed with or without the aid of automated processes in connection with personal data such as
  collection, organization, ordering, storage, adaptation, alteration, reading, querying, use, disclosure
  through transmission, dissemination or other form of provision, matching or linking, restriction, erasure or
  destruction. Any processing of personal data must be carried out according to a valid legal basis out of
  those recognized by art. 6 GDPR and only for the purpose they have been collected for.

* **Personal data** within the meaning of the GDPR are all information relating to an identified or
  identifiable natural person; a natural person is considered as identifiable if it can be directly or
  indirectly identified, in particular by association with an identifier such as a name, an identification
  number, location data, an online identifier or one or more special features, the expression of the physical,
  physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of this natural person. The principles
  of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for the processing of personal data must be

   fairness and transparency");

   scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1),
   not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes ("purpose limitation");
3. adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are
   processed ("data minimization");
4. accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal
   data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or
   rectified without delay ("accuracy");
5. kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the
   purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar
   as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or
   historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to
   implementation of the appropriate technical and organizational measures required by this Regulation in
   order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject ("storage limitation");
6. processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
   unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate
   technical or organizational measures ("integrity and confidentiality"). \
