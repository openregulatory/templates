## Data Processing Activities

> Note that this tab should exist twice: one time for internal processing activities and one time for external
> ones. *Internal* processing refers to your internal data that third parties may process on your behalf (for
> example: your tax accountant, your cloud provider, providers of all the tools you use in your
> company). *External* processing refers to data of third parties that you process on their behalf (for
> example: customer data that is transferred to your servers to be analyzed by your brand-new AI algorithm).

## Threshold Analysis and Data Protection Impact Assessment

> Note that it is the responsibility of the controller to carry out a DPIA (Art. 35 GDPR)
>
> Optionally, you can split this section into two separate tabs.
>
> Reasoning: whenever a risk is deemed acceptable in a previous section, the documentation ends right
> there. For example, if the overall severity and probability of a risk are deemed acceptable, you don't have
> to dive into further evaluation criteria of the next section or let alone start the DPIA for this
> risk. Sections are shown in the text below in brackets - use different formatting when you adopt this
> template).
>
> As part of your DPIA, you typically analyze several risk causes. More risk examples are listed in the risk
> methodology section.
