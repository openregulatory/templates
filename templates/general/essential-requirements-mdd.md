# Essential Requirements MDD (93/42/EEC)

> This document goes through all essential requirements as listed in Annex I of the MDD. Please don't get
> confused: Contrary to all other templates here, quoted regions below (like this one) don't contain
> explanations (like this one), but instead actually quote the relevant section of the MDD. So, the legalese
> below is not me explaining stuff to you - it's the MDD.
>
> Underneath each requirement, you determine whether it's applicable to your product. I've pre-filled it,
> making a few assumptions for software. But you should definitely go through all of them, just to make sure,
> e.g., 10 (do you have a measuring function?) and 12.4 (are you monitoring clinical parameters of
> patients?). Good luck.

## 1

> The devices must be designed and manufactured in such a way that, when used under the conditions and for the
> purposes intended, they will not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patients, or the safety
> and health of users or, where applicable, other persons, provided that any risks which may be associated with
> their intended use constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefits to the patient and are
> compatible with a high level of protection of health and safety.

 * **Applicable:** Yes
 * **Evidence of Conformity:** ISO 14971:2019 (Risk Management Report), Clinical Evaluation

> medical and physical conditions of intended users (design for lay, professional, disabled or other users).

 * **Applicable:** Yes
 * **Evidence of Conformity:** IEC 62366-1:2015 (Usability Evaluation Report)

## 2

> The solutions adopted by the manufacturer for the design and construction of the devices must conform to
> safety principles, taking account of the generally acknowledged state of the art.
>
> In selecting the most appropriate solutions, the manufacturer must apply the following principles in the
> following order:
>
>  * Eliminate or reduce risks as far as possible (inherently safe design and construction),
>  * Where appropriate take adequate protection measures including alarms if necessary, in relation to risks
>    that cannot be eliminated,
>  * Inform users of the residual risks due to any shortcomings of the protection measures adopted.

 * **Applicable:** Yes
 * **Evidence of Conformity:** ISO 14971:2019 (Risk Management Report)

## 3

> The devices must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured and
> packaged in such a way that they are suitable for one or more of the functions referred to in Article 1 (2)
> (a), as specified by the manufacturer.

 * **Applicable:** Yes
 * **Evidence of Conformity:** IEC 62304:2006 (Software Verification), Clinical Evaluation

## 4

> The characteristics and performances referred to in Sections 1, 2 and 3 must not be adversely affected to
> such a degree that the clinical conditions and safety of the patients and, where applicable, of other
> persons are compromised during the lifetime of the device as indicated by the manufacturer, when the device
> is subjected to the stresses which can occur during normal conditions of use.

 * **Applicable:** Yes
 * **Evidence of Conformity:** ISO 14971:2019 (Risk Management Report), IEC 62304:2006 (Software Verification
   & Validation)

## 5

> The devices must be designed, manufactured and packed in such a way that their characteristics and
> performances during their intended use will not be adversely affected during transport and storage taking
> account of the instructions and information provided by the manufacturer.

 * **Applicable:** No

## 6

> Any undesirable side-effect must constitute an acceptable risk when weighed against the performances
> intended.

 * **Applicable:** Yes
 * **Evidence of Conformity:** ISO 14971:2019 (Risk Management Report)

## 6a

> Demonstration of conformity with the essential requirements must include a clinical evaluation in accordance
> with Annex X.

 * **Applicable:** Yes
 * **Evidence of Conformity:** Clinical Evaluation

## 7: Chemical, physical and biological properties

* **Applicable:** No

## 8: Infection and microbial contamination

* **Applicable:** No

## 9.1

> If the device is intended for use in combination with other devices or equipment, the whole combination,
> including the connection system must be safe and must not impair the specified performances of the
> devices. Any restrictions on use must be indicated on the label or in the instructions for use.

 * **Applicable:** Yes
 * **Evidence of Conformity:** ISO 14971:2019 (Risk Management Report)

## 9.2

> Devices must be designed and manufactured in such a way as to remove or minimize as far as possible:
>
>  * The risk of injury, in connection with their physical features, including the volume/pressure ratio,
>    dimensional and where appro- priate ergonomic features,
>  * The risks connected with reasonably foreseeable environmental conditions, such as magnetic fields, external
>    electrical influences, electrostatic discharge, pressure, temperature or variations in pressure and
>    acceleration,
>  * The risks of reciprocal interference with other devices normally used in the investigations or for the
>    treatment given,
>  * The risks arising where maintenance or calibration are not possible (as with implants), from ageing of
>    materials used or loss of accuracy of any measuring or control mechanism.

 * **Applicable:** No

## 9.3

> Devices must be designed and manufactured in such a way as to minimize the risks of fire or explosion during
> normal use and in a single fault condition. Particular attention must be paid to devices whose intended use
> includes exposure to flammable substances or to substances which could cause combustion.

 * **Applicable:** No

## 10: Devices with a measuring function

 * **Applicable:** No

## 11: Protection against radiation

 * **Applicable:** No

## 12.1

> Devices incorporating electronic programmable systems must be designed to ensure the repeatability,
> reliability and performance of these systems according to the intended use. In the event of a single fault
> condition (in the system) appropriate means should be adopted to eliminate or reduce as far as possible
> consequent risks.

 * **Applicable:** Yes

## 12.1a

> For devices which incorporate software or which are medical software in themselves, the software must be
> validated according to the state of the art taking into account the principles of development lifecycle,
> risk management, validation and verification.

 * **Applicable:** Yes
 * **Evidence of Conformity:** ISO 14971:2019 (Risk Management Report), IEC 62304:2006 (SOP Software
   Development, Software Verification & Validation), IEC 62366-1:2015 (Usability Evaluation Report)

## 12.2 - 12.3

 * **Applicable:** No

## 12.4

> Devices intended to monitor one or more clinical parameters of a patient must be equipped with appropriate
> alarm systems to alert the user of situations which could lead to death or severe deterioration of the
> patient's state of health.

 * **Applicable:** No (no monitoring)

## 12.5 - 12.8

 * **Applicable:** No

## 13 Information supplied by the manufacturer
