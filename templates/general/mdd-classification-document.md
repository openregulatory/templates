> under the assumption of a stand-alone software medical device. However, this is a quite essential document
> and you're better off checking twice.

**1.4 Active Medical Device**

| Definition | Applicable |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Any medical device operation of which depends on a source of electrical energy or any source of power other than that directly generated by the human body or gravity and which acts by converting this energy. Medical devices intended to transmit energy, substances or other elements between an active medical device and the patient, without any significant change, are not considered to be active medical devices.<br>Stand alone software is considered to be an active medical device. | Yes |

**1.5 Active Therapeutical Device**

| Definition | Applicable |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| Any active medical device, whether used alone or in combination with other medical devices, to support, modify, replace or restore biological functions or structures with a view to treatment or alleviation of an illness, injury or handicap. |  |

**1.6 Active Device for Diagnosis**

| Definition | Applicable |

## Chapter 2: Implementing Rules

| Rules | Applicable |
| ----- | ---------- |
| 2.1: Application of the classification rules shall be governed by the intended purpose of the devices. | Yes |
| 2.2: If the device is intended to be used in combination with another device, the classification rules shall apply separately to each of the devices. Accessories are classified in their own right separately from the device with which they are used. |  |
| 2.3: Software, which drives a device or influences the use of a device, falls automatically in the same class. |  |
| 2.4: If the device is not intended to be used solely or principally in a specific part of the body, it must be considered and classified on the basis of the most critical specified use. |  |
| 2.5: If several rules apply to the same device, based on the performance specified for the device by the manufacturer, the strictest rules resulting in the higher classification shall apply. |  |
| 2.6: In calculating the duration referred to in Section 1.1 of Chapter I, continuous use means ‘an uninterrupted actual use of the device for the intended purpose’. However where usage of a device is discontinued in order for the device to be replaced immediately by the same or an identical device this shall be considered an extension of the continuous use of the device. |  |
