# Document Roadmap TechDoc

This is a proposed roadmap to creating the TechDoc file. The documents are grouped by "Design Phase". To each
document, a responsible person is assigned as the author. Go through the list phase by phase. You can mix up
the order of documents within a phase, but I recommend to finalize documents from one phase before moving on
to the next.

### PHASE 1: Planning & Feasability
| Document                                        | Author                        | Comment                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Intended Use                                    | CEO                           | This is the most important document of your TechDoc. Business and Regulatory Strategy depend on it.                                                                                |
| Medical Device Classification                   | QA/RA Manger                  | Defining the product's medical device classification acc. to MDR.                                                                                                                  |
| Product Roadmap                                 | Product Manager               | Not an essential document. This is for feasibility assessments and resource planning. Helps to keep track of what's to come.                                                       |

| Risk Management Plan and Risk Acceptance Matrix | Risk Manager                  | Specifies the methods for assessing risks to be used for the product at hand. Defines probability and severity categories and acceptable ranges.                                   |

### PHASE 2: Specification

| Document                             | Author                               | Comment                                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| User Needs List                      | Product Manager                      | This is a list of high-level requirements. Most of them will be implemented through Software Requirements. |
| User Needs Checklist                 | QA/RA Manager                        | Checking if the User Needs List makes sense.                                                               |
| Software Requirements List           | Developer-adjacent person            | Specifying how User Needs will be incorporated in the software. Describing the details of a feature.       |
| List of Hazard-Related Use Scenarios | Risk Manager                         | Identifying scenarios in which users could be prone to hazards.                                            |
| Risk Table                           | Risk Manager                         | Anticipating and assessing risks. Gathering input from various channels.                                   |
| Software Requirements Checklist      | QA/RA Manager                        | Checking if the Software Requirements List makes sense.                                                    |
| Software Test Plan                   | Software Developer                   | Defining tests for every Software Requirement and mapping them to each other.                              |
| Usability Test Plan                  | Product Manager / Usability Engineer | Specifying the methodologies to be used to conduct the Usability Test.                                     |



### PHASE 3: Development

| Document              | Author             | Comment                                                                                                         |
|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SOUP List             | Software Developer | List of external libraries, frameworks and packages used in the product, incl. their assessment of criticality. |
| Software Architecture | Software Developer | Description/Graphic outlining the software components and their interaction.                                    |

The actual programming work takes place in this phase. It makes sense to create the SOUP list and the software
architecture immediately before programming begins and to adjust them if anything changes during code
creation. These documents should actually be created in advance, but due to the iterative nature of software
development, it will not be possible to plan everything before the actual work begins. Therefore, it makes
sense to create them in parallel with the programming.

### PHASE 4: Verification and Validation
