This is a Failure Mode and Effects Analysis ([FMEA][wikipedia-fmea]) of the device. It is separated into
multiple sections:

 * **Failure Modes** lists everything which can go wrong
 * **Hazards and Analysis** lists everything (harms) which can subsequently happen, including an analysis of
   probability and severity
 * The list of **Risk Control Measures** contains all control measures which were implemented for risk
   reduction, either reducing probability or severity, or both.

## 1. Preliminary Hazards Analysis (PHA)

> A Preliminary Hazards Analysis (PHA) is simply a list of stuff which can go wrong. Typically, you come up
> with that stuff when you think about your product. Like, when you do Covid predictions, you come up with the
> thought that a wrong prediction will result in a bad outcome. Makes sense. So, here's a table in which you
> can collect those ideas. Besides the description it also has the column "source" which describes where the
> idea came from (typical options are: Intended Use, User Test, 14971 checklist (there is one in the 2012
> version, otherwise there's TR 24971, I think)) and "Hazard ID(s)" which shows where you've continued the
> analysis (including probability and severity) of that risk. It refers to the ID(s) in the Hazards and
> Analysis table below.

| ID | Source                 | Description                           | Hazard ID(s) |
|----|------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1  | General Considerations | Wrong Covid Prediction                | 1            |
| 2  | Intended Use           | Wrong Covid Prediction                | 1            |
| 3  | Usability Test         | User misunderstands prediction result | 1            |


## 2. Failure Modes

> This is a list of stuff which can go wrong in your software. You should be able to come up with things while
> you write code and when you think about it. Typically, stuff which always can go wrong is 1) something
> becomes unavailable, 2) something returns invalid data, 3) something gets hacked.

> I've written some examples for the Covid predictor application which I cover in my videos - you don't have
> to watch those for now. The idea is that it's an app which predicts whether a certain patient has Covid,
> pretty magical. An obvious failure mode would be that the app either calculates wrong predictions on the
> backend (ID 1), or the frontend displays the predictions wrongly (ID 2). They both lead to the same hazard
> (ID 1) which is listed in the Hazards and Analysis table below.

| ID | Software System | Failure Mode                       | Hazard ID(s) |
|----|-----------------|------------------------------------|--------------|
| 1  | Backend         | Wrong Covid Prediction             | 1            |
| 2  | Frontend        | Covid Prediction displayed wrongly | 1            |

## 3. Hazards and Analysis

> This is a list of stuff which will subsequently happen after your software has failed. It's more about what
> happens in the real world, not in your software. The 14971 wants you to analyze Hazards, Hazardous
> Situations and Harms, so that's what you'll find in the table :)
>
> Here's what happens: In the beginning, there's a hazard, like a wrong Covid prediction. That hazard has a
> certain probability to lead to the (next) hazardous situation, in this case 1% (0.01), in which the user
> thinks he is healthy, but actually has Covid. You can estimate p1 with some medical knowledge, in this case
> maybe the prevalence of Covid in your target population.
>
> Then, this hazardous situation may lead to a harm, in this case, disease progression - the user who got the
> wrong Covid prediction (healthy) may actually have Covid and now stay at home instead of going to the
> hospital. So the disease gets worse. Maybe only 10% (0.1, p2) of users will actually blindly trust my Covid
> app - so not all of them will get disease progression. Again, estimate this based on your own data.
>
> Finally, you multiple p1 with p2, check your Risk Acceptance Matrix (see template for the risk management plan) which Probability
> Category it is (in this case P4). Also check that matrix which severity that harm would be, I'm just
> assuming it could be S2 here. Once you have your Probability (P) and Severity (S), check your matrix whether
> that's acceptable. In this case, it's not.
>
> So we need a Risk Control Measure which is referenced here by ID (1). As we can see, it reduced the
> probability to P3, but not the severity. But that's fine, because the P3 and S2 - combination is acceptable,
> based on our Risk Acceptance Table.
>
> The next table contains the list of Risk Control Measures.

| ID | Hazard                 | p1   | Hazardous Situation                      | p2  | Harm                | p1*p2 | P  | S  | Acceptable? | Comment | Risk Control ID(s) | P  | S  | Acceptable? |
|----|------------------------|------|------------------------------------------|-----|---------------------|-------|----|----|-------------|---------|--------------------|----|----|-------------|
| 1  | Wrong Covid prediction | 0.01 | User thinks he is healthy, but has Covid | 0.1 | Disease progression | 0.001 | P4 | S2 | No          |         | 1                  | P3 | S2 | Yes         |

## 4. Risk Control Measures

> This is the table of Risk Control Measures which was referenced from the Hazards and Analysis table
> above. We've used the Risk Control Measure with (ID 1) to reduce the risk of disease progression. For that,
> we came up with a procedure to check our prediction algorithm with test data before we ship it. That makes
> sense and that should probably reduce the probability of wrong predictions. In this case, by 0.01 (10^-2,
> I'm coming up with numbers here). It doesn't reduce the severity, of course - the harm is still disease
> progression.

> Note that the 14971 has three types of Risk Control Measures:
> * Inherent Safety by Design
> * Protective Measures
> * Information for Safety
>
> Also note that, in simplified terms, Information for Safety must actually be displayed in your application
> to have any effect. Like, not in the user manual, because nobody reads the manual.

| ID  | Description | Type | Probability Reduction | Severity Reduction | New Risk Introduced by Mitigation Measure |
| --- | ----------- | ---- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Check prediction algorithm with test data | Protective Measure | 10^-2 | 1 | No |
