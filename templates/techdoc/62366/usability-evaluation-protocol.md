# Usability Evaluation Protocol

## Mapping of Standard Requirements to Document Sections

| IEC 62366-1:2015 Section | Title                                         | Document Section |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------|
| 4.2                      | Usability Engineering File                    | (all)            |
| 4.3                      | Tailoring of the Usability Engineering effort | (all)            |

## 1. User Group and Environment

> Describe the user group here, e.g., physicians with experience in a certain field.

> Also, describe the environment in which the user test is being conducted. Obviously, both the user group and
> environment should match whatever you described in your Intended Use. So, if your app is intended to be used
> by emergency physicians in a brightly-lit hospital environment, you should also have these people do the
> usability test in a similar environment.

## 2. Preparation

> Describe whether you prepare users in any way. Again, this should be based on the use context in which your
> users will be using your device in real life. So, if people typically carefully read the user manual before
> (not sure in which parallel universe that happens), you can give them the manual and some time to study
> it. More realistically, you'll probably test how users handle your device when they haven't read the manual.

> If there are official training which are required before users can use your device, you should do this
> training first, of course.

## 3. List of Tasks

> This table lists the tasks you want your users to perform. It's kind of the master table which will be
> copy-pasted for each user below - you'll be filling out the observations and hazards encountered by each
> user.

> As always, using a spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets) instead of a document is a very good idea here.

| ID | Description | App State / Environment | Instructions | Acceptance Criteria | Observations | Hazards encountered |
|----|-------------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|
|    |             |                         |              |                     |              |                     |

## 4. Protocols

> Copy-paste the table above for each user and fill it out during the test. Note down the names and ages (or
> any other important characteristics) per user.

### User 1 (Name, Age)

| ID | Description | App State / Environment | Instructions | Acceptance Criteria | Observations | Hazards encountered |
|----|-------------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|
|    |             |                         |              |                     |              |                     |

### User 2 (Name, Age)

| ID | Description | App State / Environment | Instructions | Acceptance Criteria | Observations | Hazards encountered |
|----|-------------|-------------------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------|---------------------|
|    |             |                         |              |                     |              |                     |
