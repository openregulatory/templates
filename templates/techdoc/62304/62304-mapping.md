# IEC 62304:2006 Mapping of Requirements to Documents

This table maps all requirements of the IEC 62304:2006 (by section) to the relevant documents (here:
OpenRegulatory templates).

> Note that the document names in the "Fulfilled in Document" column are based on the OpenRegulatory
> templates. You'll probably have a different system for assigning document names, so feel free to rename
> them.
