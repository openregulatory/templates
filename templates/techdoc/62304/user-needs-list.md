# User Needs List

> This is a list of your user needs (also referred to as "stakeholder requirements"). This is what you would
> most commonly start with for your requirements mapping: it is the most high-level part of your design
> input. Describe the generic requirements your device will need to meet. Only in a next step, these user
> needs will be translated into (and linked to) software requirements which will present the technical
> specifications of your product.

> Of course, you could also use your own tool like Jira or GitHub issues for this. Just ensure that the
> content (i.e. the columns shown here) is roughly the same.

## Mapping of Standard Requirements to Document Sections

| ISO 13485:2016 Section | Document Section |

| 5.2                      | Identify user interface characteristics related to safety and potential use errors | 1                |
| 5.6                      | Establish user interface specification                                             | 1                |

## 1. User Needs

> Your user needs should typically take into account:
>
> * Regulatory requirements
> * Use requirements for product functionalities, safety and performance in order to fulfill its intended use.
> * Requirements from risk management: include all hazard-related use scenarios that must be tested during
>   usability tests (note the last column on the right for that).
