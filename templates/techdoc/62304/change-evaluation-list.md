## Summary:

This list is used to document the evaluation of all regular change requests according to the company's change
management process.

## Evaluation of Product Changes

> Disclaimer for Use #1: You may want to separate your lists for product and organizational changes, as you
> should release a new list for every product version. This is to separately identify all changes related to
> that specific version. Each product version list should ideally be attached to the respective technical
> documentation file.

> Disclaimer for Use #2: If any of the below mentioned categories are answered with YES, this indicates that
> your change must be classified as significant.

> Disclaimer for Use #3: In the example content filled into the table below, "PCR" stands for "Product Change
> Request" and "OCR" stands for "Organization Change Request".

**Please note:**

* YES in the first two categories (intended use / essential requirements / GSPR) always leads to a significant
  change.
* If the device is modified (a) to correct an error, for which there is a safety risk to the patient if the
  error is not corrected or (b) as part of field safety corrective actions for an incident, the change is
  discussed with the Notified Body to determine the significance of the change. If no Notified Body was
  involved in the conformity assessment process of the device, the change is treated as a significant change.

>   impacting the diagnosis or therapy delivered to the patient
> * a software change only intended to correct an inadvertent logic error that does not pose a safety risk and
>   brings the system back into specification
> * a software change that consists only of tightening of design specifications within specified tolerances
>   and where there is no creation of new features
> * changes to labelling to include additional languages required in other regulatory jurisdictions
> * minor changes to clarify the existing wording of warnings and precautions. However, in the case where
